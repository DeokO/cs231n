Project
=======
No current project implementation. This is the start of some tensorflow code.

tutorials
---------
Will include tensorflow tutorial code.

### `tutorials/basic/beginners_tutorial.py`
Full connected (FC) two layer network (classification network over MNIST dataset); Can achieve 92% accuracy (test accuracy);

### `tutorials/CNN_tutorial.py`
5 layer CNN network. 3 layers of CNN (3x3 filters), 1 full connected layer hidden layer, 1 full connected layer to output; Uses ReLU activation and max pooling (2x2); uses dropout on the full connected layer. Can achieve 99% accuracy.

autoencoder
-----------
Simple implmentation of CNN encoder - FC decoder over the MNIST dataset.
